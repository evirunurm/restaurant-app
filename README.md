# Restaurant Menu Web Application 

This project was created during my journey studing in a **Coding Bootcamp**. 
It was a group project : We were suposed to recreate a given design and add some functionalities 
  - Cart
  - Filtering system 
  - Pop-ups
  - JS Modules
  - ...
 ***
 It was developed with **vanilla JavaScipt**, which you might think was a waste of time. 
 But it wasn't, because it teached us how hard / time-consuming it is to do some very basic things in vanilla, and to show us why **JavaScript frameworks** were craeted. 
 It took us nearly two weeks to build. 
 During this project I learned a lot about the **boundary** between **data** and **DOM**. That was the main thing I struggled with. 
 I spent over 3 days **planning** algorythms and **refactoring** yerserday's code.
